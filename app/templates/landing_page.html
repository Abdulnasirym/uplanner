      <p class="card-text">The inspiration for creating this Task Planner app stems from my personal struggle with managing multiple commitments effectively. As a software engineering student at Holberton School, juggling coursework, coding projects, personal errands, and even moments of relaxation became overwhelming. I often found myself missing deadlines, forgetting tasks, or feeling stressed over time management.<br><br>

      One particular moment that sparked the need for a solution was during a hectic week where I missed an important project submission due to a lack of proper planning. This incident made me realize the value of having a tool that could help me track tasks, set reminders, and give me a sense of control over my schedule.<br><br>

      That experience led to the idea of building a simple yet effective task management tool. With this Task Planner, I aimed to create something that could help not only me but others who face similar challenges. I wanted to build a tool that was easy to use, intuitive, and kept users on top of their tasks by sending timely reminders. As part of my Portfolio Project for Holberton School, this app became an opportunity to put into practice the skills I’ve learned, while solving a real-world problem that resonates with me personally.<br><br>

      Though this project was a requirement for my coursework, it is much more than that. It’s a tool I would use myself, and I hope it can be valuable for others who are looking to simplify their daily workflow.<br><br>
